SQLite demo using Xamarin.Forms
From SomosTechies.com

SQLite-net is an open source, minimal library to allow .NET and Mono applications to store data in
[SQLite 3 databases](http://www.sqlite.org). It was first designed to work with [Xamarin.iOS](http://xamarin.com),
but has since grown up to work on all the platforms (Xamarin.*, .NET, UWP, Azure, etc.).

SQLite-net was designed as a quick and convenient database layer. Its design follows from these *goals*:

* Very easy to integrate with existing projects and runs on all the .NET platforms.
  
* Thin wrapper over SQLite that is fast and efficient. (This library should not be the performance bottleneck of your queries.)
  
* Very simple methods for executing CRUD operations and queries safely (using parameters) and for retrieving the results of those query in a strongly typed fashion.
  
* Works with your data model without forcing you to change your classes. (Contains a small reflection-driven ORM layer.)
